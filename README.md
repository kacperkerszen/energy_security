This project focuses on analyzing the energy security in European Union (EU) countries. Using various analytical methods including:
- linear ordering,
- principal component analysis (PCA),
- cluster analysis.
The project aims to assess the energy situation in individual EU member states. Key variables such as the share of renewable energy, dependency on fossil fuels, energy import reliance, energy consumption, and the population unable to heat their homes were analyzed to gauge energy security. The project concludes with a summary highlighting the countries with the most robust energy security indicators, such as Sweden, Finland, Austria, and the Netherlands.
